jqGauges for jQuery Plugin

===========================
Installlation
===========================

Download and unzip the contents of the archive to any convenient location. The package contains the following folders:

- [js] - The javascript files of jqGauges (and the needed libraries). You need to include them in your HTML page, in order to gain the client side functionality of the gauges. 
The first file is "jquery-1.5.1.min.js" - this is the official jQuery library. jqGauges is built upon jQuery library version 1.4.3.
The second file you need is the "excanvas.js" javascript file. It is used from the versions of IE, which dosn't support canvas graphics.
The third is the jqGauges javascript code itself, located in "jquery.jqGauges.min.js".

- [css] - Contains the Css files that the jqGauges needs. 

- [samples] - Contains some examples that use the jqGauges. For full list of samples plese visit - http://www.jqchart.com/jquery/gauges

The final result you will have in a HTML page containing jqGauges would be something similar to that:

Licensing
============================
This is our evaluation free unlimited in time trial license. We are very helpful to ALL customers, including trial customers and will gladly assist you 
with any problems you might have (send questions to support@jqchart.com). Trial product will show a tiny message pointing to our site every once in a while. 
To remove that, just purchase the single developer versions and we will send you a download link to unrestricted versions.

It's as simple as that, no cryptic settings in configs, no registry settings - complete license freedom (so you can use it on test/deployment servers, have QA look it at without licenses issues, etc)
